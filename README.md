# **Bioinformatics: class notes**
technology: 
 - R, robot
 - N, nanotech
 - G, genetics
## 1.gene: coding & non-coding
- questions in Science:humans have so few genes, interaction between genetic variation and personal health
- human genome: 3GB, ~21000 genes, huge amount of non-coding(lncRNAs: MALAT1, HOTAIR)
## 2.method: sequencing & computing
- revolution in sequencing: 2008
- 3 steps of bioinformatics:
  1. information: wet experiments, images/sequences
  2. model: mathematical & probability model
  3. algorithm: computational
    - Model is an abstract modeling of a real problem, usually by converting a concrete question into a mathematical problem and describing it using mathematical language(usually), mainly used for making predictions and decisions, such as decision trees and neural networks.
    - Algorithms are problem-solving on the computer using a series of instructions or steps, usually used for processing data and generating results, such as various sorting algorithms.

# **bioinformatics: study plan**
## target  
- learn and familiarize with linux system, learn to use R language
- acquire the most basic coding skills needed for bioinformatics (this is my preliminary goal in learning bioinformatics since I have no foundation in CS and omics)
## plan
- basically grasp the bioinformatics data analysis methods taught in class
- read the tutorial and scientific paper about bioinformatics after class
